# VBA-Challenge
VBA Homework
So I struggled with this assignment.  I was having a hard time getting my for loop to start, read the correct dates.  When doing the Alphabetical stocks first, my code would work fine across all spreadsheets because my start and end dates were static.  When moving over to the multi-year spreadsheet, I coudn't figure out out to get it to read the end date of YYYY1231.  Maybe this wasn't the right cell to have the spreadsheet read but I wasn't sure where to apply the For Loop for columns, if that applied.  Also, my code to find the greatest %, decrease, etc. worked but the ticker didn't apply conistently.  It would work on the second try of running the macro.  I tried putting it at the beginning, middle, end and out of the loop but I couldn't get it to read on the first macro run.  I went ahead and update the code to work on all spreadsheets even though it won't run on 2019 and 2020 without some manipulation in the code.  My struggle might have had to do with assigning values that could loop properly and increment with any spreadsheet.  I just couldn't figure out how to overcome it.


# Resources
I used google and Stack Overlfow.
  Stack Overflow I used code Ticker_row to learn how to apply a increment counter to this project.  Stack Overflow also provided code to the application.worksheet.max/min formulas which I applied.

Co-Pilot did provide some examples but no code was used.
